This framework integrates a dual-lens approach to risk assessment:

Business lens using OWASP Risk Rating (Likelihood × Impact → Low/Med/High/Critical)

Technical lens using CVSS v3.1 scoring (0.0-10.0 → Low/Medium/High/Critical)

It encourages linking business-impact assessments with technical severity metrics so that decisions are both risk-informed and measurable.
Key components:

Threat identification (e.g., STRIDE, misuse cases)

Control mapping (linking threats → controls → evidence)

Scoring via OWASP Risk Rating + CVSS where applicable

Traceable decision records and register entries
